      "content='In C, the ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing a simple `if-else` statement.  It\\'s a conditional operator that takes three operands and evaluates to one of two values based on a condition.\\n\\n**Syntax:**\\n\\n```c\\ncondition ? expression1 : expression2;\\n```\\n\\n**How it works:**\\n\\n1. **Condition:** The `condition` is evaluated.  It must be an expression that results in a boolean value (true or false, represented by non-zero or zero respectively).\\n\\n2. **Evaluation:**\\n   - If the `condition` is true (non-zero), `expression1` is evaluated and its value becomes the result of the entire ternary expression.\\n   - If the `condition` is false (zero), `expression2` is evaluated and its value becomes the result of the entire ternary expression.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```c\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int a = 10, b = 20, max;\\n\\n  max = (a > b) ? a : b; //Ternary operator\\n\\n  printf(\"The maximum value is: %d\\\\n\", max); // Output: The maximum value is: 20\\n\\n  return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example:\\n\\n- `(a > b)` is the condition.  Since `a` (10) is not greater than `b` (20), the condition is false.\\n- Therefore, `b` (20) is assigned to `max`.\\n\\n**Another Example with different data types:**\\n\\n```c\\n#include <stdio.h>\\n\\nint main() {\\n  int age = 25;\\n  char *status = (age >= 18) ? \"Adult\" : \"Minor\"; \\n  printf(\"Status: %s\\\\n\", status); // Output: Status: Adult\\n\\n  return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHere, the ternary operator selects a string literal based on the age.\\n\\n\\n**Important Note:**  While the ternary operator is concise, overuse can make code harder to read.  For complex conditional logic, a standard `if-else` statement is often preferred for better clarity.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-1.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': []} id='run--5771bd35-43d3-43a7-95b5-53c1ee4d392a-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8, 'output_tokens': 472, 'total_tokens': 480, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}}\n"
